      <h2>LABORATORY</h2>
      <P>The workshop has all necessary machines to carry out tensile and compression test of metals and non-metals. Impact testing machine used to find the impact strength of materials specimen. Lab also have the model of IC Engines and different types of boilers.There are many types of lab facilities, including research labs, clinical labs, and hospital labs. These laboratories are categorized depending on the type of service, purpose, and function they are providing their clients.imple machines: A machine that has very little or no moving parts that make doing work easier. Examples are the wedge, lever, wheel and axle, screw, inclined plane, and pulley. Mechanical Advantage: The ratio of the output force from the machine to the input force initially applied to it.Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind. This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation, world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.Mechanical engineers design power-producing machines, such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines, as well as power-using machines, such as refrigeration and air-conditioning systems. Mechanical engineers design other machines inside buildings, such as elevators and escalators.</P>
